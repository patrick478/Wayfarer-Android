Make the initial conversation
It is important to be honest and clear when you talk to the person. Ask them if they are thinking about suicide and why. It is ok to talk about it. Don’t worry about giving them ideas.
Have you made the initial conversation?

Remove potential means of suicide.
These include pills, knives, razors, or firearms. If the person is likely to take an overdose, keep medications locked away or give out only as the person needs them. They are likely to listen to you if you act as an authority figure.
Have they surrendered all possible weapons?

Ask person to seek professional help. 
Do everything in your power to get a suicidal person the help he or she needs. Call a crisis line for advice and referrals. Encourage the person to see a mental health professional, help locate a treatment facility, or take them to a doctor's appointment.
Have they agreed to professional help?

Make a safety plan. 
Help the person develop a set of steps he or she promises to follow during a suicidal crisis. It should identify any triggers that may lead to a suicidal crisis, such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Also include contact numbers for the person's doctor or therapist, as well as friends and family members who will help in an emergency.
